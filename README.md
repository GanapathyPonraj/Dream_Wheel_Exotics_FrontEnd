# ðŸ“– Dream Wheel Exotics - Frontend <a name="about-project"></a>

**Dream Wheel Exotics** is a sophisticated Full Stack application that demonstrates my proficiency in both Frontend and Full Stack development. Developed using the MERN stack, the app incorporates advanced features such as JWT authentication for secure user access and WebSocket connections for real-time updates on user favorites. The application is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring optimal user experiences on various devices, including phones, tablets, laptops, and desktops. One of the key highlights of this project is the implementation of RESTful APIs, which enable users to seamlessly create bookings, add and manage their favorite cars, and allow owners to dynamically update car details. This project not only showcases my technical skills but also my ability to create user-centric applications that are both functional and visually appealing.

## Frontend

The frontend was made with react and can be found [here](https://github.com/GanapathyPonraj/Forecastify](https://github.com/GanapathyPonraj/Dream_Wheel_Exotics_FrontEnd)
